# Face-Detection-Using-dlib-hog-and-cnn

Dlib includes two face detection methods built into the library:
- A HOG + Linear SVM face detector that is accurate and computationally efficient
- A Max-Margin (MMOD) CNN face detector that is both highly accurate and very robust,capable of detecting faces from varying viewing angles, lighting conditions, and occlusion.

In this repo:
- 'hog_face_detection.py' applies dlib's HOG + Linear SVM face detector.
- 'cnn_face_detection.py' utilizes dlib's MMOD CNN face detector.
